{{{guestsNames attending=rsvpd}}},

We've reserved blocks of rooms at a hotel in Pleasaonton for guests attending our wedding. These room blocks expire at the end of June, so if you're planning to attend and have not reserved a hotel room, we recommend you do soon.

All the info you'll need to reserve a hotel room is on our website:
http://wedding.danerina.com/logistics/hotels/

When booking a reservation it's best to call the hotel and mention it's for the "Tabara/Scholl" wedding.

We'll see you soon!
